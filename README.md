# Image-Classification-with-MNIST-Convnet

Image classification is indeed a subfield of computer vision which involves training neural networks to recognize and categorize images into predefined classes. This has applications in various fields such as object detection, facial recognition, medical diagnosis, and even autonomous driving.

Image classification has become an essential component of many applications, including search engines, social media platforms, and e-commerce sites. As the field continues to advance, it has the potential to impact many industries and change the way we interact with technology.

 MNIST is a database of handwritten digits. It is the most commonly used dataset for learning Image Recognition. It is labelled in the sense that each image of handwritten digit has the corresponding numeral value attached to it. This helps our Algorithm/Neural Network to learn which image stands for which number(0-9) and to learn hidden patterns in human writing.
